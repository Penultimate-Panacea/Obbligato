### Abstract
This is based on the wonderful website LibraryOfBabel.info and inspired by years of watching Vi Hart.

### Definitions
When I first embarked upon this project, I had some amount of musical background (I had studied music theory for a few years when I played my high school's Jazz Band as a pianist) yet, I had never had need of the exact definitions of terms used in describing music. I found a fair amount of contention between the terms: Pitch, Tone, Voice, and Note in particular.
While in normal conversation these differences are often inferred from context, and if you are conversing about them chances are that your partner will correct you or ask for clarification if it is needed, when it came time to start to write the classes for this program exact definitions were needed.
I recognize that what follows may not be exactly correct. However, I needed something to name the classes and I feel that consistency in naming will provide a substitute for correctness for now.

##### Tone
One of the 88 keys on the piano (matched with frequency)
##### Note
Extends Tone, adds information about how long the tone is held for.

### Limitations
##### Time
The first build will not include information about how long notes are held (making them effectively the same as tones). I do not yet know whether or not I want to have discrete levels of time (whole note subdivided) or some more continuous measure (hold for 0.625 seconds). The former way makes more sense for encoding the information into the algorithm but,
